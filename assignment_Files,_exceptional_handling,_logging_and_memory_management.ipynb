        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        "  -  Interpreted languages execute code line by line using an interpreter, which makes debugging easier but execution slower. Compiled languages translate the entire code into machine code before execution, resulting in faster performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  -  Exception handling in Python allows you to manage errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks. It prevents programs from crashing due to unexpected errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "  -  The finally block contains code that runs regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is commonly used for cleanup actions like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        "  -  Logging is a module in Python used to record messages about program execution. It helps in debugging and monitoring code behavior over time, especially in production environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the **del** method in Python?\n",
        "  -  The **del** method is a destructor method that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It allows you to define cleanup actions for objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  -  The import statement imports the whole module, whereas from ... import lets you import specific functions or classes from a module, reducing the need to reference the module name.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " -   You can handle multiple exceptions using multiple except blocks or by grouping exceptions in a single except block using parentheses.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  -  The with statement ensures proper acquisition and release of resources, like automatically closing a file after its suite finishes, even if an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  -  Multithreading allows concurrent execution of tasks within the same process using threads, while multiprocessing runs tasks in separate processes with separate memory space, ideal for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  -   Logging provides insights into the programâ€™s execution flow, errors, and status. It helps in debugging, maintenance, and understanding program behavior over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        "   -  Memory management in Python involves automatic allocation and deallocation of memory through a private heap and garbage collection, managed by the Python memory manager.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " -    The basic steps are: place risky code in a try block, catch exceptions using except, optionally use else for no-exception case, and finally to execute cleanup code.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  -   Memory management ensures efficient use of memory, avoids memory leaks, and enhances performance by freeing unused memory through garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        "    - The try block wraps the code that may raise an error. If an error occurs, control moves to the except block to handle the exception, preventing crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "   -  Python uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to automatically reclaim memory from objects that are no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        "    - The else block runs if the try block does not raise an exception. It is useful for code that should only run when no errors occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        "   -  Common logging levels include DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL, used to categorize the importance or severity of messages.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        "   -  os.fork() is a low-level Unix function that creates a child process, while multiprocessing is a high-level Python module that abstracts process management and is cross-platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "    - Closing a file frees system resources, ensures data is written to disk, and prevents data corruption or file access issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "   -  file.read() reads the entire file content as a single string, while file.readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "   -  The logging module is used to track events during program execution, log messages to files or console, and help in debugging and error tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        "   -  The os module provides functions to interact with the operating system, like file creation, deletion, directory management, and path operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "    - Challenges include circular references, memory leaks due to unreferenced objects, and managing memory efficiently in large applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "   -  You can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword followed by an Exception class, e.g., raise ValueError(\"Invalid input\").\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "   -  Multithreading improves performance in I/O-bound applications by allowing concurrent execution and better utilization of CPU resources.\n"
